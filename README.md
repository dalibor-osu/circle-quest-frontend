# About

Osu quest is aiming to be a fun website for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) players, where they can compete by completing various types of quests and hopefully improve while doing so.

## Development

Development has basically just started, but if you're interested and want to get more info, feel free to join Circle Quest [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vPejHcgQey)!

This repository is for fronend development of Circle Quest. Frontend is build with [react](https://reactjs.org/). There are several other repositories (like backend server and documentation) that I'm keeping private for now.
